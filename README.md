## ❓ Why Are There No Code Files?
These projects were developed as part of my **Bachelor’s coursework**, where access to project repositories was limited due to **institutional policies** and **university-managed infrastructure**. Many of these projects were built using **academic computing environments** (e.g.university servers) and were not accessible for long-term storage after course completion. 

Additionally, projects involving **real-time data processing** and **ML workflows** were executed in environments where exporting entire codebases was restricted to prevent academic dishonesty. While I currently do not have the original code files, this repository serves as a **documentation of my work**.
